"""Judge (generation-quality) metrics — LLM-graded, so noisy and median-damped.

Unlike the retrieval metrics, these come from an LLM grader (RAGAS) and move a
few percent between identical runs. So the suite runs the grader N times and
takes the **median** per metric, and records the spread (min/max/runs) — that
measured variance is what justifies the wide tolerance bands in eval_config.yaml
(build step 4).

What each metric measures, and what a failing case looks like:

* faithfulness       Is every claim in the answer grounded in the retrieved
                     context? Fails when the answer asserts facts the context
                     does not support (hallucination).
* answer_relevancy   Does the answer actually address the question? Fails on
                     evasive or off-topic answers.
* context_precision  Are the retrieved contexts relevant and well-ranked
                     (signal over noise)? Fails when the top contexts are junk.
* answer_correctness Does the answer match the ground truth? Reported but never
                     gated — too noisy to be a build signal (eval_config).

A `Grader` scores a batch of samples and returns one aggregate (mean over
samples) per metric, for a single run. `run_judge` handles the median-of-N.
Two graders ship: `RagasGrader` (real, lazy-imported, needs a key) and
`HeuristicGrader` (deterministic, offline, lexical proxies — for tests and
offline runs; NOT a real quality signal).
